As you've guessed, I'm backend developer with nearly 2 years of experience. I love computers and digital world as far as I could remember,
I would've play around with some technologies like `Unity` and `C#` because of my passion about Game Desiging, But then I found myself in web development mostly working in backend part of this massive field.

I consider myself disciplined, good at R&D and I pay alot of attention to details. It's important for me to design & architect a working system in a right way. 

I really enjoy backend more than frontend, and I'm currently working & learning `DevOps` mindset and stack. I'm enteting DevOps roadmap from the *Development* part and I love it already!

I will continue learning each and everyday and I'm having a fun time traveling this marvelous tech journey :D
