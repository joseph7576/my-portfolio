As you may have inferred, I am a backend developer with nearly 2 years of professional experience. My fascination with computers and the digital world has been deeply ingrained in me since my earliest memories. Initially, my passion for game design led me to explore technologies such as `Unity` and `C#`. However, as time progressed, I found myself in web development, primarily focusing on the backend aspects of this vast field.

I pride myself on being a disciplined individual who excels in R&D, and I consistently prioritize attention to details. Ensuring that a system is designed and architected correctly holds great importance to me.

I am currently actively engaged in learning and implementing the `DevOps` mindset and stack. My entry into the DevOps roadmap originates from a development background, and I am already enamored with this field.

I am committed to continuous learning, dedicating myself to acquiring new knowledge and skills each day. This journey through the ever-evolving realm of technology has proven to be a delightful adventure for me.
