### How To Get This Theme

1. Go to this github repo -> [Gatsby Theme Portfolio Minimal](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal)

3. Done :)

- As a side note: you can go and check [my own github repo](https://github.com/joseph7576/my-portfolio) for this theme, feel free to explore it. And ofcourse you can use my skills icon there :D
